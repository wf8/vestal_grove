here we will use all 20 quadrats (#4-23)

get the 2013 data from the online calculator

quadrats 4-12, 15-16, & 20-23 remained the same throughout the entire time. 
limit this study to just those 15 quadrats. 

quadrats remained the same the entire time, 
with the exception of the second year (1986-87) which ended at quadrat 16, 
so omit that year?


all quadrats are in the woodland, and that area has been managed as a unit. 

Stephen's notes on the quadrats to leave out:
1, 2, and 3 are a mesic, wet-mesic opening where little has been done and which, I think, hasn’t changed much. Some day we’ll pay attention to them.
13 and 14 are a mesic opening in the woodland.
17, 18, and 19 are an opening along a small stream.
All 8 of these quadrats had too little oak leaf litter to burn regularly. They’re different.
The last five quadrants but could be included for some purposes, if wanted.
