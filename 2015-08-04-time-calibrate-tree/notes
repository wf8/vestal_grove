Penalized likelihood method used in r8s with the truncated Newton method with bound constraints

The optimal value of the smoothing parameter was determined by a cross-validation procedure over
10 values ranging from 10^-5 to 10^5, each separated by one order of magnitude.

for cross-validation to find optimal smoothing:
divtime method=PL algorithm=TN crossv=yes cvstart=-5 cvinc=1 cvnum=10;

once we have optimum smoothing:
set smoothing=100;
divtime method=PL algorithm=TN;
